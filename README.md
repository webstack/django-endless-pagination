# Django Endless Pagination

Django Endless Pagination can be used to provide Twitter-style or
Digg-style pagination, with optional Ajax support and other features
like multiple or lazy pagination.

The initial idea, which has guided the development of this application,
is to allow pagination of web contents in [very few steps](<http://django-endless-pagination.readthedocs.org/en/latest/start.html>).

**Documentation** is [available
online](http://django-endless-pagination.readthedocs.org/), or in the docs
directory of the project.

To file **bugs and requests**, please use
<https://github.com/frankban/django-endless-pagination/issues>.

The **source code** of this package is hosted at
